    <h4 class="led">Welcome</h4>
    <p>Led Departure Board is a webapp designed to re-create the platform signs you get at uk train stations. The data is collected live from national rail and displayed in a custom panel.</p>
    <p>The main use case for this app is to set it up on a permanent screen which constantly shows the next trains at a specific station.<br> The boards refresh every <strong>16 seconds</strong> with the most up to date data, so there is no need to manually refresh.</p>
    <h4 class="led">How to Use</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>To change the station just modify the url. E.g <a [routerLink]='["/EUS"]'>www.leddepartureboard.com/EUS</a> will show euston station times</li>
      <li>To change the amount of boards on the screen just add a number to the end. E.g <a [routerLink]='["/EUS/12"]'>www.leddepartureboard.com/EUS/12</a> </li>
      <li>To view a single platform style board just modify the url with a prefix of 'singleboard'. E.g <a [routerLink]='["/singleboard/EUS"]'>www.leddepartureboard.com/singleboard/EUS</a> </li>
      <li>To specify a specific platform just add the platform parameter. E.g <a [routerLink]='["/EUS?platform=5"]'>www.leddepartureboard.com/EUS?platform=5</a> will show euston station times on platform 5 only<br>(You can also click on the platform number on the display to filter to that platform only)</li>
    </ol>
