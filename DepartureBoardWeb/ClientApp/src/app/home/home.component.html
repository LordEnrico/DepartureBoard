  <h4 class="led">Welcome</h4>
  <p>Led Departure Board is a webapp designed to re-create the platform signs you get at uk train stations. The data is collected live from national rail and displayed in a custom panel.</p>
  <p>The main use case for this app is to set it up on a permanent screen which constantly shows the next trains at a specific station. The boards refresh every 16 seconds with the most up to date data, so there is no need to manually refresh.</p>
  <h4 class="led">How to Use</h4>
